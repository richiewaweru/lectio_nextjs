      <h1>Teaching moves, validation, and polish</h1>
      <p className="lead">
        Lectio components are named for what they do in a lesson, not for generic UI roles. Lean on
        registry metadata and validation to keep generated content honest and teachable.
      </p>

      <h2>Design for the learner arc</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Match template intent</strong> — Pick a template whose contract fits the instructional
          flow (compare/contrast vs lab vs formal track). Required components in the contract are there for
          a reason.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Respect capacities</strong> — Registry entries document min/max items, hint limits, and
          behaviour modes. Exceeding them triggers validation warnings and can clutter the UI.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use the right cognitive job</strong> — When browsing the{" "}
          <Link href="/showcase">showcase</Link>, read the cognitive job and group; it encodes how the
          piece should feel in context.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Validate early</h2>
      <p>
        During integration, call <code>warnIfInvalid(section)</code> in development builds or log{" "}
        <code>validateSection(section)</code> server-side when ingesting generated JSON. Fix upstream
        generation when warnings appear instead of silencing them.
      </p>

      <h2>Math and media</h2>
      <p>
        KaTeX is bundled for math strings in content. Keep expressions within supported LaTeX subsets your
        pipeline can guarantee. For <code>SimulationBlock</code>, prefer structured fields; when using{" "}
        <code>html_content</code>, treat it as trusted or sanitized in your app policy.
      </p>

      <h2>Accessibility and motion</h2>
      <p>
        Prefer semantic structure from templates over ad-hoc div stacks. Respect reduced-motion preferences
        already handled in shared styles; avoid adding disruptive animation outside the design system.
      </p>

      <h2>Keep contracts fresh</h2>
      <p>
        If you fork or extend Lectio React, run <code>npm run export-contracts</code> after registry or
        template changes so external agents never train against stale JSON.
      </p>
